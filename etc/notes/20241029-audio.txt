Reimplementation is underway but now that I'm implementing WebAudio, noticing some more difficulty.
I want to make it stupid simple. So simple that we can't help getting it right.

- Collect all voices directly against the global context.
- - Flag voices as belonging to the song, so we can release them on song changes.
- - This means no more post pipes or song overlap.
- Mono only. The global context will still output at any channel count, but it will just duplicate the one channel.
- No pitch wheel.
- Go back to universal envelopes instead of the bespoke ADSR with shared timing we tried at 20241015.
- Nix the PCM format. Use WAV, but a simplified form.
- - Have cvta2a accept WAV=>WAV and MIDI=>MIDI conversion for sanitization.
- MIDI: Put the entire EGS header in a single event. There's no value in separating per channel.
- Have the editor accept EGS in addition to MIDI, and don't allow embedded MIDI in the EGS Header event.
- Don't use Control 0x07 Channel Volume except maybe during initial defaulting. All channel config lives in the EGS event.

TODO
- [x] Core native synth.
- [x] synth_formats
- [ ] native: sub
- [x] Revise compiler.
- [x] cvta2a sanitization
- [ ] Editor.
- [ ] Web synth.
- [ ] Confirm we're ignoring ignorable things, for future-proofing.
- [ ] eggdev_compile_song_gm.c: Canned GM instruments and drums.
